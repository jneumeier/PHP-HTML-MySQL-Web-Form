About This Program:
*********************

This is a web form that saves entries with PHP and MySQL, and displays the entries to the user with PHP in conjunction with MySQL database calls. JavaScript jQuery is used to make the main form dynamic.


*********************
Planned New Features:
*********************
- Proper form validation to require date entry, team entry, and all empty player textboxes to be filled. This will be implemented using jQuery.
- Photo upload link next to each player entry textbox. Player photo will be displayed to the user if the user clicks on the player name in the displayPlayers.php webpage.
