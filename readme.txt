About This Program:
*********************

This is a web form that saves entries with PHP and MySQL, and displays the entries to the user with PHP in conjunction with MySQL database calls. JavaScript JQuery is used to make the main form dynamic.


*********************
Planned New Features:
*********************
- Combo box for team entry that exists alongside the text input. Text input will be labeled as only for use for a new team to be added to the database.
- HTML form validation to require all empty player textboxes to be filled.
