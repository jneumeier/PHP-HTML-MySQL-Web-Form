About This Program:

- Combo box for team entry that exists alongside the text input. Text input will be labeled as only for use for a new team to be added to the database.
- Button on main form to go to another page displaying all teams with their respective players.
- HTML form validation to require all empty player textboxes to be filled.
- Functionality to add/remove player name entries on main form.
