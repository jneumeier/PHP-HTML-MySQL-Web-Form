About This Program:
*********************

Text-and-date HTML form that saves entries with PHP, displays the entries to the user with PHP, saves them as session variables, then allows the user to return to the main form with all information pre-filled (using those PHP session variables). All entries are stored in a MySQL database.


*********************
Planned New Features:
*********************
- Combo box for team entry that exists alongside the text input. Text input will be labeled as only for use for a new team to be added to the database.
- Button on main form to go to another page displaying all teams with their respective players.
- HTML form validation to require all empty player textboxes to be filled.
- Functionality to add/remove player name entries on main form.
